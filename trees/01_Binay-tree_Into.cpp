// TYPE OF BINARY TREES:
//1.FULL = every node has 2 or 0 children
//2.COMPLETE = every level is completely filled except the last level
// and last level should have nodes as left as possible
//3.PERFECT = all leaf nodes at same level
//4.BALANCED = the height of tree should be logn n= no of nodes
//5.DEGENERATE // SKEWED = like linked-list each node has only 1 children.
